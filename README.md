	<h1>rojo-feature-router</h1>
    <p>An automatic, file-system based router for roblox-ts and luau. Organize feature logic in a single directory.</p>
</div>

## Why use it?
While **folder-by-type** (i.e. putting all components in one folder, all services in another) is simple, it becomes difficult to manage as projects grow, requiring you to jump between folders to edit one feature. 

**Folder-by-feature** (i.e. grouping all related files together) is superior for scaling, maintainability, and team collaboration. It makes it easier to add, modify, or delete features.

## Automatic Routing
The router determines a file's destination using three main strategies. Folder-based routing takes precedence over suffix-based routing.

### 1. Folder Context (Primary)
If a file is located within a folder named after a service or a keyword, it is automatically routed to that service.
* **Keywords:** `server`, `client`, `shared`
* **Services:** `ReplicatedFirst`, `ServerStorage`, `StarterGui`, etc.
* **Behavior:** All files and sub-folders within these directories inherit the target service.

### 2. Suffix Context (Secondary)
If a file is in a generic folder, the router inspects the filename for a suffix. This allows you to define a file's destination without moving it into a specific sub-folder.
* **Delimited Suffixes:** Use a separator such as a dot, hyphen, or underscore.
    - Examples: `auth.server.ts`, `input-client.ts`, `data_shared.ts`

* **PascalCase Suffixes:** Append the service name directly to the end of the filename.
    - Examples: `AuthServer.ts`, `InputClient.ts`, `DataShared.ts`

    **Note:** The router strips the suffix for the final Rojo object name. `AuthServer.ts` becomes `Auth` in Roblox. This can be stopped by setting `appendSuffix = true` instead.

### 3. Default
If neither matches, the file defaults to `ReplicatedStorage`.

## Setup & Integration
Integrate the router into your workflow to ensure your `default.project.json` stays synchronized with your file system.

### 1. Install Dependencies
Copy the `feature-router.js` script into your project (e.g. in the `tools/` directory). Then, modify the settings and rojo tree at the top of the script to your need.

Also, you will need a few development tools to handle the watching, routing and concurrent execution for the commands:
```bash
npm install -D tsx chokidar-cli concurrently
```

### 2. Update JSON Scripts
Add the following scripts to your package.json to automate the build process:

#### luau
```json
"scripts": {
    "router": "node tools/feature-router.js",
    "build": "npm run router",
    "watch": "chokidar \"src/**/*\" -c \"npm run router\"",
    "sourcemap": "rojo sourcemap --watch default.project.json --output sourcemap.json",
    "dev": "npm run build && concurrently \"npm run watch\" \"rojo serve\" \"npm run sourcemap\""
},
```

#### roblox-ts
```json
"scripts": {
    "router": "node tools/feature-router.js",
    "build": "npm run router && rbxtsc",
    "watch": "concurrently \"chokidar \"src/**/*\" -c \\\"npm run router\\\"\" \"rbxtsc -w\"",
    "dev": "npm run build && concurrently \"chokidar \"src/**/*\" -c \\\"npm run router\\\"\" \"rbxtsc -w\" \"rojo serve\""
},
```

Make sure to add the following to your tsconfig.json:
```json
"exclude": [
	"tools"
]
```

### 3. Commands
* **npm run build:** Generates the latest project map (and performs a single roblox-ts compilation).  
* **npm run watch:** Monitors your src directory. If you add or move a folder, the mapper instantly updates your Rojo project (and code compilation).  
* **npm run dev:** The dev command. It builds, compiles, starts all watchers, and launches the Rojo server all in one go.
